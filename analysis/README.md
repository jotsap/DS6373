## Intial findings 
  
Noticiable discrepancy between the totalTest Results vs negative + positive. I created a separate column testDiscrepancy and absTestDiscrepancy for this, and have done some analysis. Not quite done yet, will have more to follow. Basically the absolute value is for aggregating and the testDiscrepancy tracks the direction, so we can do a time series model separately on how good or bad their data collection is over time, and the effects on deaths, positive test results, etc.  
  
Bam, there is our second model
